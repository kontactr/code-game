progress pop-up issue:
    As the modal opens in the sync mode, 
    browser doesn't get time to render it instant
    because the function which contains the model
    is running, we need to async the after statements
    till the modal opens.

improve async syntax:
    Wrap into settimeout function with 0 wait time.
    and we can also use settimeout in async queue while
    calling functions. As we have already used/implemented
    reduce function it's easy for us to return promise.
    It will work like a sequence.

hoisting:
    Currently hoisting is not supported because
    user can only add statements in a top-down
    approach beacuse of this currently we don't 
    need hoisting. user has to add defination 
    first before using it. If we add this in future,
    we will have to change in the custom validation
    function. we need to separate the comparision
    of definations and calls. first we have to search
    for definations, then for calls, then for scops.
    or definations on the first level and 
    scope and call are on the second level.
    Hoisting is in need when we add support
    for statement drag and drop means statement
    order change support.

context:
     For performance improvement, we need to add context
     in the custom validations of the mods. which help
     us to prevent dual check for the tree. for example
     currently we are using the same comparision function
     for async and normal functions. if both are present
     in the structure, we don't have to run comparision
     function both times. any other one can handle the
     cases. With the help of the context we can check
     whether we will have to call it or not. so In the
     next time we can skip it.
