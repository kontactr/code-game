progress pop-up issue:
    As the modal opens in the sync mode, 
    browser doesn't get time to render it instant
    because the function which contains the model
    is running, we need to async the after statements
    till the modal opens.

improve async syntax:
    Wrap into settimeout function with 0 wait time.
    and we can also use settimeout in async queue while
    calling functions. As we have already used/implemented
    reduce function it's easy for us to return promise.
    It will work like a sequence.
